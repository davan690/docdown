# DocDown

An Electron menu bar application which takes Markdown files, filters them through a Zotero bibliography file, a CSL file, and a reference .docx file, and exports a Word document with embedded citations and styles.

DocDown is essentially a wrapper for the process elaborated in [this blog post](https://raphaelkabo.com/blog/posts/markdown-to-word/).

## Requirements

- Pandoc (downloadable from [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html))
- A Zotero .bib file (instructions in the blog post linked above)
- A CSL file (ditto - they all live [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)
- A reference .docx file (an example is available from the blog post)

## Installing

A MacOS binary is available [here](http://raphaelkabo.com/assets/DocDown.dmg).
